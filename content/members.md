<img class="portrait" src="/assets/img/bieske.jpg" width="160px" /> Evan Bieske has been at the University of Melbourne since 1995. His research mainly entails using laser spectroscopy to investigate the properties of charged molecules, complexes, clusters and nanoparticles in the gas-phase. These research interests were initiated during PhD studies, under the supervision of A.E.W. Knight at Griffith University, Australia, and extended while working as a research fellow with J.P. Maier in Basel, Switzerland. When not working he prefers to clamber about on rock faces, an activity he undertakes at a progressively lower level. He is currently an ARC Australian Professorial Fellow.
